# x402api TypeScript and JavaScript SDK

Official server-side TypeScript and JavaScript SDK for the x402api public API.
The package name is `@x402api/sdk` and the production API endpoint is
`https://api.x402api.com`.

> **Release status:** this repository contains the generation and release
> configuration. The package installation command becomes available when the
> first synchronized SDK release is published.

## Requirements

Node.js 22 or newer.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @x402api/sdk
# or: pnpm add @x402api/sdk
```

## Using the x402api TypeScript and JavaScript SDK

The examples below show the configured public surface. Generated request and
response model names are documented under `docs/` after the first SDK generation.

### Configure authentication

Create a scoped tenant API key in x402api and expose it to the server process as
`X402API_TENANT_API_KEY`. The SDK sends it as a bearer credential. Never embed a
tenant API key in browser, mobile, desktop, or other distributed client code.

### Initialize the client

```typescript
import { X402Api } from "@x402api/sdk";

const sdk = new X402Api({
  security: {
    tenantApiKey: process.env.X402API_TENANT_API_KEY ?? "",
  },
});

const readiness = await sdk.paymentReadiness.retrieve();
const payments = await sdk.payments.list({ pageSize: 25 });

console.log(readiness);
console.log(payments);
```

The idiomatic method shape for this SDK is `sdk.resourceName.methodName(request)`.
All request fields are collected into a typed request object so new optional API
fields do not break existing call sites.

### Create a charge

The logical SDK call is `charges.create`. Supply a unique `Idempotency-Key` for
each intended mutation and reuse the same key only when retrying that exact
request. The request contains a resource-version UUID, the protected URL, one or
more asset prices expressed in atomic units, and an expiry between 30 and 3600
seconds.

The equivalent HTTP request is useful for validating credentials independently
of the SDK:

```bash
curl --request POST https://api.x402api.com/v1/charges \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $X402API_TENANT_API_KEY" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --header "Idempotency-Key: charge-$(date +%s)" \
  --data '{
    "resource_version_id": "00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001",
    "resource_url": "https://merchant.example.com/premium-report",
    "prices": [{
      "asset_id": "base_usdc",
      "amount_atomic": "1000000"
    }],
    "expires_in_seconds": 900,
    "metadata": {"customer_reference": "customer-123"}
  }'
```

### Read payment state and receipts

Use `payments.list` for a tenant-wide view, `payments.retrieve` for one payment,
`payments.listObservations` for chain evidence, and `payments.retrieveReceipt`
for the signed final receipt. Retrieve the public verification-key history with
`receiptVerificationKeys.retrieve` before verifying receipts offline.

### Cursor pagination

`orders.list`, `payments.list`, `payments.listObservations`,
`receivingAddresses.list`, `resources.list`, and `resources.listVersions` accept
`pageSize` (1-100) and an optional opaque `cursor`. Do not decode or construct
cursors. Read the next cursor from `X-X402API-Next-Cursor` or the `Link` response
header and pass it unchanged to the next call.

### Idempotent mutations

Every mutating operation marked in the function table requires an idempotency
key of 8-160 characters matching `[A-Za-z0-9._:-]+`. A transport timeout does
not prove that a mutation failed. Retry the same payload with the same key, or
call `idempotency.getOutcome` to resolve its durable outcome.

### Errors, retries, and HTTP metadata

The SDK raises or returns a typed `X402ApiError` for documented 4xx, 5xx, and
default error responses. Generated responses use the `envelope-http` format so
callers can inspect the decoded body, status code, and response headers. The SDK
applies short exponential-backoff retries to connection failures and status
codes 408, 429, 500, 502, 503, and 504. Application-level retries must still
respect idempotency requirements.

## Source contract and releases

This repository is generated from the versioned public OpenAPI contract at
[`https://api.x402api.com/openapi/openapi.json`](https://api.x402api.com/openapi/openapi.json).
SDK releases are prepared from an immutable Speakeasy registry tag only after
the deployed production contract matches the source artifact at the JSON data
model level.

- All five official SDKs use the same stable SemVer as the public API contract.
- Backward-compatible production contracts may publish automatically.
- Breaking contracts require a new major version and explicit approval.
- Every generation run records the source Git revision and contract digest.
- `USAGE.md` contains hand-maintained examples that survive regeneration.

## Contributing

Most source files in this repository are generated. Open an issue for API or SDK
feedback. Changes to the public contract, generator configuration, or persistent
documentation should be made in the source repository so they propagate to all
five SDKs consistently.
